      <h2>Hello</h2>
      <p class="intro">I am a Computer Science student at<br><a href="https://www.salford.ac.uk/">Salford University</a>
        and this is my first website. Below I talk alittle about the Modules am doing so far. I hope you like it.

      <h2>My Modules</h2>

        <img class="java-logo" src="img/java_logo.jpg" alt="Java_Logo">

        <h3>Java</h3>
        <p>Java is probably one the thoughest module we take comparing the other modules we do in <abbr
            title="Computer Science">CS</abbr>. This subject can be really easy to follow if you keep constantly
          practicing and reading how the objects and class and functions,loops,ect interect with each other and to be
          honest it can be really fun and stressing to learn but you know... we don't borned acknowledging
          everything...or maybe we do?</p>

      </div>
      <div class="module">
        <img class="ubuntu" src="img/ubuntu-logo.png" alt="ubuntu-logo">

        <h3>Computer Systems Internals &amp; Linux</h3>
        <p>So far Linux is one of the subject that i enjoy doing as all the workshops are always challeging because we
          only work with the <span><a href="https://tutorials.ubuntu.com/tutorial/command-line-for-beginners#0">comand
              line</a></span>(ins this link you can practice some linux &#128076;) and the VIM editor which at the
          begining can be stress full to learn as you will only use your keyboard and leave your mause aside while you
          modify files&#128163; or creat files and to be honest it makes feel like a hacker...but all we are doing is
          practicing how to retrieve/modify information from files.</p>
        <p>In the other hand Computer system internal at the biging is sorft of hard and boring at the same time due to
          the fact that you need to get use to conver bites to decimals and so on and its pretty much theorical and not
          much practicing.
        </p>

      <div class="module">
        <img class="dbs" src="img/dbs1.svg" alt="Database_Logo">

        <h3>Database Systems</h3>
        <p><abbr title="Data Base Systems">DBS</abbr> is as complex as java but this ones is complex by nature!ðŸ˜« but
          once you hit the point on how it works you can just do queries with eyes close!!! <abbr
            title="Structured Query Language">SQL</abbr> at some point i compered it like learing german because you
          write as its pronounce so you can put the queries which are expecific questions to get expecific answers from
          the DBS. Keeping uptodate is the key for this subject and dont fall behind as me that i need to revesise the
          whole semester again for not giving it the relevance it needed...</p>
      </div>
      <div class="module">
        <img class="web-development" src="img/website-design-iow.png" alt="Web_Development_Logo">

        <h3>Web Development</h3>
        <p>Many student opts follow the way of web-development as it can be the "eassiest" to study but the reality is
          that is easy to code and complex in the creativity point of view as you need to have that "taste" of machting
          color and a propiate layout for the specific content you are creating plus having some background in how color
          and fonts works as this can be really influencial in our physcology.</p>

        <img class="pdp" src="img/pdp.png" alt="Professional_Development_Logo">

        <h3>Profeccional Development &amp; Practices</h3>
        <p>The less attractive and the <strong>most</strong> relevant subject in CS. From what i saw this first semester
          this class was the most avoided by students by only attending 5~15 student per class in my group. I belive
          that this is due to the high volume of theory and theres no much code and the relevance that this provide us
          is huge as introduce as to the legal issues(complex issues as well) involving technologies and the importance
          of thinking the background in this laws and how they can be applied to protect us or protect our enteties. as
          our proffesor said: is not necesarely to learn the laws but is really importance of knowing them and how they
          are applied.</p>
